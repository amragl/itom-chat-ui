    "CHAT-002 is a small-complexity ticket that unblocks CHAT-004 (layout shell) and CHAT-032 (theme system) -- completing it quickly maximizes downstream throughput.",
    "After CHAT-002, prioritize CHAT-005 (env/CORS config, high priority, small complexity) and CHAT-008 (TypeScript types, high priority, medium complexity) as they unblock Phase 2 tickets.",
    "CHAT-006 (WebSocket infrastructure) is large complexity but high priority and unblocks streaming and real-time features in Phases 2 and 5 -- schedule it early."
